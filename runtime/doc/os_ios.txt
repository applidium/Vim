					*ios* *iOS* *iPhone* *iPad*

This file documents the particularities of the iOS version of Vim.

NOTE: The virtual keyboard on iOS doesn't have an Esc key. The Esc key has
been mapped to the backslash key. You can customize this to fit your taste.

1. General                      |ios-general|
2. User interface               |ios-ui|
2. iTunes files sharing         |ios-itunes|

Vim on the iOS has been made possible by Applidium, http://applidium.com

==============================================================================
1. General	               				*ios-general*

Vim on iOS behaves much like other unix versions, but some restrictions apply:
 - Vim is running in a sandbox. You can only edit files within the $HOME
   directory. Other files are accessible read-only.
 - Unfortunately, Vim cannot start (nor ship with) any external binary. This
   is a limitation of the iOS SDK, and cannot be worked around.

==============================================================================
2. User interface	        			*ios-ui*

The iOS virtual keyboard lacks many keys (Esc, Control, Meta, Alt to name a
few). Some people make the decision to add an extra row of keys, but we
decided that Vim was flexible enough to work with only the system keyboard.
This leaves more screen real-estate for the actual text.

Unfortunately, without an escape key it's not possible to leave insert mode.
That's why by default the backslash key ('\') is mapped to the 'Esc' key.
You're free to overwrite this setting by unmapping the backslash key.

Mouse events are also fully supported. Clicking and panning with a single
finger will generate click and drag events. Panning with two fingers will
generate scrollwheel events (horizontal and vertical).

==============================================================================
3. iTunes file sharing	        			*ios-itunes*

Getting files in or out of Vim is currently possible thanks to iTunes. Using a
simple drag'n'drop gesture, you can add (or remove) files from your $HOME
directory straight from iTunes. Just navigate to your iOS device, go in the
'Apps' tab, and select 'Vim' at the bottom of the window.
